# DOMKit
Simplifying the creation of essential HTML elements while applying some default styling.

## Introduction
Simplicity. All developers love it, and it makes creating projects easier and faster. I'm exactly the same, a sucker for . If I can find a more simple solution to an issue that creates the same output, of course I'm going straight for the simple solution. Gets the job done, you know?

## The Solution
I wanted to make creating website easier and quicker than ever, and still be able to customise my DOM elements and place them exactly where I wanted them. I wanted to use Flexbox and Grid layouts, but didn't want to write countless lines of CSS code to style them to my satisfaction.
So, I created DOMKit, written entirely in JavaScript. It contains a wide range of functions for all your needs and wants for a website. Flexbox, navigation bars, grid layouts, you name it.
